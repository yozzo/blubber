# Blubber

Blubber is a framework designed to act as a JSON client and
provide tools to build a CRUD application using GDS styles.

package name was available.

The main components of Blubber are:

* Promise based JSON API Client
* Entity collection lists with sorting and filtering
* Entity displays display
* Form definition and generation
* Form post handling
* Transformation between API interface and form data
* Nunjucks macros for rendering GDS style list/form layout
* Sass library to enhance GDS styles
